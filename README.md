# MatrixOperationsConsoleApp

In this project, the corresponding element of the new matrix will be calculated by multiplying the corresponding elements on matrix1 and matrix2 and summing all the values. If we open it, there will be a function called operation1. This function returns D value according to the transaction type. If the transaction type is 0, the D value is 0 (zero), and if the transaction type is 1, the D value is calculated according to this (𝐹−12) equation. After finding the D value according to the operation type, the size of the new matrix is calculated according to this (𝐺−𝐹+2𝐷1+1) equation. After these operations, the necessary codes are written and the matrix1 and matrix2 elements are multiplied with each other, their values are added and transferred to a new matrix.
In order for our program to run, the matrix1 and matrix2 size, operation type and seed values determined to generate random values will be taken from the user with the command line argument. Then we are asked to run the program.
